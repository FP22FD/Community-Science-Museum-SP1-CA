# Community-Science-Museum-SP1-CA

<!-- A simple overview of use/purpose. -->

Noroff SP1 Semester project website The website is called `Community Science Museum` and the target audience is children from 7 to 15 years old interested in art, technology and music.

The website is hosted at the following url: <https://shimmering-peony-58cb28.netlify.app>

## Description

<!-- An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use. -->

The main goal of this repository is to implement the Figma design and a live website I made for the `Community Science Museum`.

The website design and implementation has been made with `Figma` and `HTML` & `CSS`:

- Trello: website site plan,
- Figma: `Personas` target audience, a flow with website structure, `Moonboard`,
- Figma prototypes for mobile and desktop version (color, contrast, font, fontype - UX/UI),
- wireframes: hand-drawn low-fidelity for mobile and desktop version,
- semantic html 5,
- responsive design (concepts, media queries, etc),
- DRY (css variables, structured code, etc),
- image optimization,
- accessibily concepts (WCAG),
- developer tools (VS Code, Prettier, DevTools, Github, Netlify, etc)
- code validation tools

Implemented structure flows:

- users can access the site by desktop and mobile devices (breakpoint at 800px).
- users will be able to navigate through all pages.
- the site has a private GitHub repository and is deployed using Netlify.

The website code has been validated using the following tools:

- check html validity: <https://validator.w3.org/>

- check css validity: <https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/>

- check redirect links: <https://validator.w3.org/checklink>

- check accessibility: <https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/>

## Dependencies

<!-- - Describe any prerequisites, libraries, OS version, etc., needed before installing the program.
- ex. Windows 10 -->

To develop the website I have used `Visual Studio Code` with `Prettier` formatter extension.

No other tools are required to compile or run the website.

NB. The implemented website version is slightly different, because few improvements to the Figma/design files were made based on the `Design course` and `HTML & CSS course`.
