                                        learning and how to stimulate it?</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        What is its importance in learning and how to stimulate it?
                                        Through the curiosity of children there is a development of creativity
                                        and reasoning of the brain. Therefore, when
                                        curiosity is cultivated in a child, learning can extend beyond the
                                        classroom.

                                        And this is not difficult to understand when we remember our own
                                        experiences. Whenever we are adults, and something
                                        interests us, we are able to memorize and learn a lot of information
                                        very quickly. This is because we are very
                                        interested in it. Consequently, it makes us want to learn more and more
                                        about the argument.

                                        Through children's curiosity there is a development of creativity and
                                        reasoning of the brain.
                                        People are curious by nature, and children want to learn and know about
                                        things from an early age. There are different
                                        ways it manifests itself in the little ones, such as in questions, in
                                        games, in experiences, and in errors and
                                        successes. To encourage children to be curious and discover more, it is
                                        important to understand that curiosity is a
                                        natural process.

                                        Generally, this characteristic is observed in the first year of life as
                                        an internal process of the child, without any
                                        external manifestations. A child's perception of the world around him
                                        begins to emerge in the second year of life, as
                                        well as his awareness that people and things are different from him.
                                        This is when the famous "why phase" begins.

                                        Here at the Community Science Museum we have many activities that
                                        stimulate children's creativity and curiosity. When
                                        you bring your children to our center, you will be amazed by how much
                                        they learn and enjoy themselves at the same time.
